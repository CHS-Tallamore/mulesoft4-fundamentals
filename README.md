# mulesoft4-fundamentals

Delta URL to hit: **http://delta-flights-api-vpun.us-e2.cloudhub.io:80/delta-flights/api**

PostgreSQL URI for the configuration: **jdbc:postgresql://@{host}:{port}/{database}**

## Notes:

If the Delta URL is not returning anything (which means my subscription for that Mule App is terminated), just import the jar file in the `setup` folder into studio and use that endpoint instead!
